In the 'challenge' namespace you previously created, create a Deployment called 'frontend-deployment' that runs a single Pod with the 'gcr.io/gke-arcade/challenge' image.

The Pod should be labeled with 'role = frontend'.

There is a partial file called deployment.yaml that has been created for you to use.

EOF

cat <<EOF > /root/.instruqt/hint.txt

Open the 'deployment.yaml' file that was created for you.

For the namepsace, use 'challenge'. This tells Kubernetes which namespace to deploy to.
For the metadata name, use 'frontend-deployment'. This determins the name of the Deployment.
For replicas, use '1'. This tells Kubernetes how many copies of your app to run.
For the matchLabels, use 'role: frontend'. This tells Kubernetes what pods this Deployment controls.
For the template metadata labels, use 'role: frontend'. This gives the Pods created by this Deployment the label 'role = frontend'.
For the image, use 'gcr.io/gke-arcade/challenge'. This tells the Pods which Docker container to run.

Create the deployment by running:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
