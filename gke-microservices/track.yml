title: Microservices on Google Kubernetes Engine
teaser: Are you a master of microservices?
description: |-
  Kubernetes Engine is a managed, production-ready environment for deploying containerized applications. It brings our latest innovations in developer productivity, resource efficiency, automated operations, and open source flexibility to accelerate your time to market.

  Kubernetes gives you the power to create, deploy and manage microservices, and Kubernetes Engine gives you this power in a fully managed environemnt.

  Are you a GKE expert? Think you have what it takes to manage some microservices? Let's find out!

  title: Create a cluster
  teaser: Let's start easy
  assignment: "Create a GKE cluster called 'challenge' with two nodes. \nMake the
    nodes 'g1-small' VMs. The zone has already been set for you! \n\nNote: Creating
    a cluster can take a few minutes. However, you can check your solution before
    the cluster is fully deployed."

    contents: "Google Kubernetes Engine is a **fully managed and enterprise grade**
      Kubernetes platform. \n\nWith Kubernetes Engine you can focus on deploying and
      managing **containerized microservices** while leaving the **node, netowrk,
      and other low level maintence** to Google."
  - type: text
    contents: "Kubernetes Engine is a **Certified Kubernetes** platform with many
      additional features designed to give you the power and flexibility you need.
      \n\nFrom **built in autoscaling, VPC native netowrking, global load balancing,
      and addons like Knative and Istio**, Kubernetes Engine gives you the tools you
      need to build **cloud native applications**."

  title: ConfigMaps and Secrets
  teaser: Harness the power of distributed environment variables
  assignment: "Create a ConfigMap called 'app' with a key named 'username', and create
    a generic Secret called 'app' with a key named 'password'. \n\n Feel free to use
    any values for the data"
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: 'Running your containers is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes
      to Kubernetes. Configuring and managing your app is equally important. Kubernetes
      provides two powerful config management primitives out of the box: **ConfigMaps**
      and **Secrets**'
  - type: text
    contents: Kubernetes **ConfigMaps** allow you to decouple configuration artifacts
      from image content to keep containerized applications portable. ConfigMaps allow
      envrionment specific data and files to be injected into your containers at runtime,
      allowing containers to be reused more easily.
  - type: text
    contents: Kubernetes **Secrets** are similar, except they are for storing confidential
      information.
