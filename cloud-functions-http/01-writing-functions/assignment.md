    Google Cloud Functions is a **serverless execution environment** for building and connecting cloud services.

    With Cloud Functions you write **simple single-purpose functions**. These functions are **attached to events** emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services.

    Your function is **triggered when an event being watched is fired**.

    Your code executes in a **fully managed environment**. There is **no need to provision any infrastructure** or worry about managing any servers.

    Cloud Functions can be written using JavaScript, Python or Go.

    You can take your function and run it in a **Node.js 8**, **Python 3.7.1**, or **Go 1.11** runtime, which makes both **portability and local testing a breeze**.
