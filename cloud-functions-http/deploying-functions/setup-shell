Using the gcloud cli, deploy your modified function.

The name of the Cloud Function must be the same as the name of the method you want it to run.

The function should "trigger on http" requests.

Note: Deploying a function can take a few minutes.

The function you want to deploy is called $FUNCTION

You want to set the function to triger on http requests, which means you want to use the --trigger-http flag

This means you can deploy the function with:
gcloud functions deploy $FUNCTION --runtime $RUNTIME --trigger-http
