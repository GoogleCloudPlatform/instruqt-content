  # What are Google Cloud Functions?
  Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. Your function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. Your code executes in a fully managed environment. There is no need to provision any infrastructure or worry about managing any servers.

  Cloud Functions can be written using JavaScript (Node.js 6.14.0, Node.js 8.14.0), Python (Python 3.7.1), or Go (Go 1.11) runtimes on Google Cloud Platform. You can take your function and run it in any standard Node.js 6, Node.js 8, Python, or Go runtime, which makes both portability and local testing a breeze.

  title: Creating Cloud Functions
  teaser: Write Cloud Functions in either Node.js, Python, and Go.
  assignment: |-
    We have **provided you with a function** written in the different languages (Node.js, Python and Go) that are supported by Google Cloud Functions.

    Open one of the functions using your favourite editor (vi, vim, nano or install your own) and change it so it returns **Hello, Google!** instead of Hello, World!.

  title: Deploying Cloud Functions
  teaser: 'Upload your function''s code to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. '
  assignment: "Using the **gcloud command-line tool**, deploy your function. \n\nTo
    deploy a Cloud Function, your code must contain a method with the same `name`
    as the Cloud Function.\n\nThe function should **trigger on http** requests.\n\nNote:
    Deploying a function can take a few minutes."

  title: Testing Cloud Functions
  teaser: Trigger your function with the command-line interface to test it's functionality.
  assignment: Let's have some fun! We have deployed a function called 'cowsay' in
    your project. Call this function using the gcloud cli
  notes:

    contents: "To support **quick iteration and debugging**, Cloud Functions provide
      a `gcloud functions call` command.\n\nThis allows you to **directly invoke**
      a function to ensure it is behaving as expected. \n\nThis causes the function
      to execute immediately, even though it may have been deployed to respond to
      a specific event."

  teaser: Invoke Cloud Functions with an HTTP request.
  assignment: "Use **curl -o result.txt <URL>** or another method to call your HTTP
    function and store the result in a file called **result.txt** \n\n Note: You can
    get your function's URL with the `gcloud functions describe` command"
