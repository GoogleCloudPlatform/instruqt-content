description: |-
  # What are Google Cloud Functions?
  Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. Your function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. Your code executes in a fully managed environment. There is no need to provision any infrastructure or worry about managing any servers.

  Cloud Functions can be written using JavaScript (Node.js 6.14.0, Node.js 8.14.0), Python (Python 3.7.1), or Go (Go 1.11) runtimes on Google Cloud Platform. You can take your function and run it in any standard Node.js 6, Node.js 8, Python, or Go runtime, which makes both portability and local testing a breeze.

  title: Creating Cloud Functions
  teaser: Write Cloud Functions in either Node.js, Python, and Go.
  assignment: |-
    We have **provided you with a function** written in the different languages (Node.js, Python and Golang) that are supported by Google Cloud Functions.

    Open one of the functions using your favourite editor (vi, vim, nano or install your own) and change it, so it returns `Hello, Google!` instead of Hello, World!.

  title: Deploying Cloud Functions
  teaser: 'Upload your function''s code to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. '
  assignment: "Using the **gcloud command-line tool**, deploy your function. \n\nTo
    deploy a Cloud Function, your code must contain a method with the same `name`
    as the Cloud Function.\n\nChoose one of the available functions and combine it
    with the corresponding `runtime`.\nThe function should `trigger on http` requests.\n\nNote:
    Deploying a function can take a few minutes."
  notes:

      In order to run a function, you need to deploy it to a Google Cloud Project.

      When you deploy your function, Cloud Functions automatically installs dependencies and compile your code if necessary.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You can deploy Cloud Functions from your **local machine** or from your **GitHub** or **Bitbucket** source repository.

      Using the gcloud command-line tool, you can deploy your function from the directory containing your function code.

      ```
      gcloud functions deploy NAME --runtime RUNTIME TRIGGER [FLAGS...]
      ```
  - type: text
    contents: "Runtime can be any of: \n- `nodejs8`\n- `python37`\n- `go111`"
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Trigger can be any of:
      - `--trigger-http`
      - `--trigger-topic`
      - `--trigger-storage`
      - a combination of `--trigger-event` and `--trigger-resource`.

  title: Testing Cloud Functions
  teaser: Trigger your function with the command-line interface to test it's functionality.
  assignment: To test the **previously deployed function**, call it manually by using
    the `gcloud functions call` command.
  notes:

    contents: "Cloud **events** are things that happen in your cloud environment.
      \n\nThese might be things like **changes to data in a database**, **files added
      to a storage system**, or a **new virtual machine instance** being created."
  - type: text
    contents: "Events occur whether or not you choose to respond to them. You **create
      a response to an event with a trigger**.\n\nA trigger is a declaration that
      you are interested in a certain event or set of events. \n\nBinding a function
      to a trigger allows you to capture and act on events. "
  - type: text
    contents: "To support **quick iteration and debugging**, Cloud Functions provides
      a `gcloud functions call` command in the command-line interface.\n\nThis allows
      you to **directly invoke** a function to ensure it is behaving as expected.
      \n\nThis causes the function to execute immediately, even though it may have
      been deployed to respond to a specific event."

  title: Calling Cloud Functions
  teaser: Invoke Cloud Functions with an HTTP request.
  assignment: "Use `curl -o result.txt <URL>` or another method to call your HTTP
    function and store the result in a file called `result.txt` \n\n Note: You can
    get your function's URL with the `gcloud functions describe` command"
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You can invoke Cloud Functions with an HTTP request using the `POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS` HTTP methods.

      From the caller's perspective, **HTTP invocations are synchronous**, meaning that the result of the function execution will be returned in the response to the HTTP request.

      HTTP Functions automatically get a fully qualified domain name and URL. This allows you to quickly build RESTful APIs and Webhooks that can immediately be used.

  title: Reading logs
  teaser: Read log lines via the gcloud command-line tool.
  assignment: |-
    Use `gcloud` to read the logs from your function.

     Note: Your functions is being called in the background every minute, so just wait for the logs to show up!
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      One of the simplest ways to debug your application is to use logging. Cloud Functions makes this simple to do.
      By default, everything sent to `stdout` and `stderr` is automatically sent to **Stackdriver Logging**.
      You can read these logs in the Stackdriver UI or using the `gcloud` CLI.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      For more advanced debugging, Cloud Functions supports the **Stackdriver Debugger**.
      This let's you set watchpoints and debug your function, even in production!
