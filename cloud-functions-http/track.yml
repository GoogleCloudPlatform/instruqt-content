  # What are Google Cloud Functions?
  Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. Your function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. Your code executes in a fully managed environment. There is no need to provision any infrastructure or worry about managing any servers.

  Cloud Functions can be written using JavaScript (Node.js 6.14.0, Node.js 8.14.0), Python (Python 3.7.1), or Go (Go 1.11) runtimes on Google Cloud Platform. You can take your function and run it in any standard Node.js 6, Node.js 8, Python, or Go runtime, which makes both portability and local testing a breeze.

  title: Creating Cloud Functions
  teaser: Write Cloud Functions in either Node.js, Python, and Go.
  assignment: |-
    We have **provided you with a function** written in the different languages (Node.js, Python and Golang) that are supported by Google Cloud Functions.

    Open one of the functions using your favourite editor (vi, vim, nano or install your own) and change it, so it returns **Hello, Google!** instead of Hello, World!.

  title: Deploying Cloud Functions
  teaser: 'Upload your function''s code to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. '
  assignment: "Using the **gcloud command-line tool**, deploy your function. \n\nTo
    deploy a Cloud Function, your code must contain a method with the same `name`
    as the Cloud Function.\n\nChoose one of the available functions and combine it
    with the corresponding `runtime`.\nThe function should **trigger on http** requests.\n\nNote:
    Deploying a function can take a few minutes."

  title: Testing Cloud Functions
  teaser: Trigger your function with the command-line interface to test it's functionality.
  assignment: To test the **previously deployed function**, call it manually by using
    the `gcloud functions call` command.
  notes:

    contents: "To support **quick iteration and debugging**, Cloud Functions provides
      a `gcloud functions call` command in the command-line interface.\n\nThis allows
      you to **directly invoke** a function to ensure it is behaving as expected.
      \n\nThis causes the function to execute immediately, even though it may have
      been deployed to respond to a specific event."

  assignment: "Use **curl -o result.txt <URL>** or another method to call your HTTP
    function and store the result in a file called **result.txt** \n\n Note: You can
    get your function's URL with the `gcloud functions describe` command"

  title: Reading logs
  teaser: Read log lines via the gcloud command-line tool.
  assignment: Use **gcloud** to read the logs from your function.
  notes:

      One of the simplest ways to debug your application is to use logging. Cloud Functions makes this simple to do.
      By default, everything sent to `stdout` and `stderr` is automatically sent to **Stackdriver Logging**.
      You can read these logs in the Stackdriver UI or using the `gcloud` CLI.

    contents: |-
      For more advanced debugging, Cloud Functions supports the **Stackdriver Debugger**.
      This let's you set watchpoints and debug your function, even in production!
