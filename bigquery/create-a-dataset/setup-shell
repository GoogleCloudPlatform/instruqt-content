In this challenge we are going to create a new dataset.

Use the bq cli to create a dataset called $random_dataset_id.

The name of the dataset is accessible as the environment variable \$DATASET_ID.
Once the dataset is created, press the A button to verify it.

If in doubt, run "bq help | grep dataset" to get some guidance.
