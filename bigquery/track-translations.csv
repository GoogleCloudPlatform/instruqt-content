teaser,Let's see how much you know about BigQuery.,,
description,"# What is BigQuery? \n\nBigQuery is Google's serverless, highly scalable enterprise data warehouse. Because there is no infrastructure to manage, you don't need to deploy any resources such as disks or virtual machines, so that you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights using familiar SQL without the need\nfor a database administrator. Let's see how much you know about BigQuery! ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-shadow-resources/bigquery/BigQuery.gif)",,
challenge-1-title,Level 1: Public Dataset,,
challenge-1-teaser,Query a dataset and figure out what's the most common name in the US.,,
challenge-1-assignment,"Use the **bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current** table to figure out what is the most common name in the US. \n\n Each row represents\nthe number of people born in the same year with the same name. \n\n **Hint**: If in doubt, start with **bq help**.",,
challenge-1-notes,There are several **public datasets** hosted in BigQuery for you to access and integrate into your applications. \n\n In this first challenge you will use a public dataset created by the Social Security Administration to figure out what's the most common name in the US.,,
challenge-2-title,Level 2: Create a dataset,,
challenge-2-teaser,First things first. Let’s create a dataset.,,
challenge-2-assignment,Now it’s your turn to **create a dataset**. Let's get started with this second challenge!,,
challenge-2-notes,"A **dataset** is a collection of tables that are contained within a specific **project**. Datasets are top-level containers that are used to organize and control access to your **tables and views**. \nA table or view must belong to a dataset, so you need to **create at least one dataset** before loading data into BigQuery.",,
challenge-3-title,Level 3: Create a table with some data,,
challenge-3-teaser,Create a table and load some sample data,,
challenge-3-assignment,Let's create a table called **road_trip** in our new dataset and load some data using the **data.csv** file and the **schema.json** file available in the home directory.,,
challenge-3-notes,"Now we are going to **create a table** and **upload some data**. \nYou can specify the schema of a table when it is created, or you can create a table without a schema and declare the schema in the load job that first populates it with data.",,
challenge-4-title,Level 4: Road trip temperature,,
challenge-4-teaser,Find out the average temperature during a west coast road trip,,
challenge-4-assignment,"<img src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-shadow-resources/bigquery/road_trip.png"" style=""float: left; padding-right: 36px; width:800px; height:485px"" /> In our previous challenge we uploaded the geolocation for our west coast trip. The data we just imported has the **date and location** of the 16 places visited. \n \n Let''s combine this with the **GHCN Daily Weather Data** we will figure out what was the average temperature in each stop and get the **overall average temperature** of the trip!",,
