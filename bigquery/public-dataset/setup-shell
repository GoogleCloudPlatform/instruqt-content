Let's use the bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current table to
figure out what's been the most common name in the US since 1910.

The name of the table is available as an environment variable \$USA_NAMES.

Each row represents the number of applicants for a Social Security card by year
of birth, state and gender. So for an example row:

+-------+--------+------+------+--------+
| state | gender | year | name | number |
+-------+--------+------+------+--------+
| NJ    | F      | 1910 | Anna |    355 |
+-------+--------+------+------+--------+

For example there were 355 females born with the name Anna in NJ during 1910.

Using this table figure out what's the most common name in the US since 1910.

When you think you know the answer, type "answer" and press ENTER.

**Hint**:
Example query:
bq query 'SELECT * FROM $USA_NAMES LIMIT 1'

Or use this command to check the schema of the table:
bq show bigquery-public-data:usa_names.usa_1910_current
EOF

cat <<EOF > /root/hint.txt
Remember that each row is aggregated by name and year. This query will help you
get very close to the answer:
    bq query 'SELECT name, sum(number) FROM '\$USA_NAMES' GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 10'
EOF

cat <<EOF > /root/choices.txt
What is the most common name?
