  # What is BigQuery?

  BigQuery is Google's serverless, highly scalable enterprise data warehouse.

  Because there is no infrastructure to manage, you don't need to deploy any
  resources such as disks or virtual machines, so that you can focus on
  analyzing data to find meaningful insights using familiar SQL without the need
  for a database administrator.

  Let's see how much you know about BigQuery!

  title: 'Level 1: Public Dataset'
  teaser: Query a dataset and figure out what's the most common name in the US.
  assignment: 'Use the **bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current** table to
    figure out what is the most common name in the US. <br><br> Each row represents
    the number of people born in the same year with the same name. <br><br> When you
    think you know the answer, type **answer** and press ENTER. <br><br> **Hint**:
    If in doubt, start with **bq help**.'

      you will use a public dataset created by the Social Security Administration
      to figure out what's the most common name in the US.

  teaser: First things first. Let’s create a dataset.
  assignment: |-
    Now it’s your turn to **create a dataset**. Let's get started with this second
    challenge!
  notes:

      A **dataset** is a collection of tables that are contained within a specific
      **project**. Datasets are top-level containers that are used to organize
      and control access to your **tables and views**.

      A table or view must belong to a dataset, so you need to **create at least
      one dataset** before loading data into BigQuery.

  teaser: Create a table and load some sample data
  assignment: ' Let''s create a table called **road_trip** in our new dataset and
    load some data using the **data.csv** file and the **schema.json** file available
    in the home directory.'
  notes:

      Now we are going to **create a table** and **upload some data**.

      You can specify the schema of a table when it is created, or you can create
      a table without a schema and declare the schema in the load job that first
      populates it with data.

  assignment: '<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-shadow-resources/bigquery/road_trip.png"
    style="float: left; padding-right: 36px" /> In our previous challenge we uploaded
    the geolocation for our west coast trip. The data we just imported has the **date
    and location** of the 16 places visited. <br><br> Let''s combine this with the
    **GHCN Daily Weather Data** we will figure out what was the average temperature
    in each stop and get the **overall average temperature** of the trip!'
