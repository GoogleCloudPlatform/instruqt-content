  # What is BigQuery?

  BigQuery is Google's serverless, highly scalable enterprise data warehouse.

  Because there is no infrastructure to manage, you don't need to deploy any
  resources such as disks or virtual machines, so that you can focus on
  analyzing data to find meaningful insights using familiar SQL without the need
  for a database administrator.

  Let's see how much you know about BigQuery!

    Now it’s your turn to create a dataset. Let's get started with this second
    challenge!
  notes:

      A **dataset** is a collection of tables that are contained within a specific
      **project**. Datasets are top-level containers that are used to organize
      and control access to your **tables and views**.

      A table or view must belong to a dataset, so you need to create at least
      one dataset before **loading data into BigQuery**.

      Now we are going to create a table and upload some data.

      You can specify the schema of a table when it is created, or you can create
      a table without a schema and declare the schema in the load job that first
      populates it with data.

    during this west coast trip. <br> The data we just imported has the date and location
    of the 16 places visited. <br> By combining this with the GHCN Daily Weather Data
    we will figure out what was the average temperature in each stop and get the overall
    temperature average of the trip!'
