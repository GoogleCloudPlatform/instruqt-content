  # What is BigQuery?

  BigQuery is Google's serverless, highly scalable enterprise data warehouse.

  Because there is no infrastructure to manage, you don't need to deploy any
  resources such as disks or virtual machines, so that you can focus on
  analyzing data to find meaningful insights using familiar SQL without the need
  for a database administrator.

  Let's see how much you know about BigQuery!

  teaser: Query a dataset and figure out what's the most common name in the US.
  assignment: "Let's use the **`bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`**
    table to figure out what's the most common name in the US.\n Each row represents
    the number of applicants for a Social Security card by year of birth.\n When you
    think you know the answer,\n    type **answer** and press ENTER.\n **Hint**: If
    in doubt, start with **bq help** or use this command to check the schema of the
    table: \n **bq show bigquery-public-data:usa_names.usa_1910_current**"

      There are several public datasets hosted in BigQuery for you to access and integrate into your applications.
       In this first challenge you will have to use a public dataset created by the Social Security Administration with a list of applicants for a SS card by year of birth to figure out what's the most common name in the US.

  teaser: First things first. Let’s create a dataset.
  assignment: |-
    Now it’s your turn to create a dataset. Let's get started with this second
    challenge!

      A dataset is a collection of tables that are contained within a specific
      **project**. Datasets are top-level containers that are used to organize
      and control access to your **tables and views**.

      A table or view must belong to a dataset, so you need to create at least
      one dataset before **loading data into BigQuery**.

  teaser: Create a table and load some sample data
  assignment: |-
    Now that we have out $DATASE_ID dataset created, let's create a table in
    that dataset called "cloud_next" and load some data using the data.csv file
    available in the home directory.

      A BigQuery table contains individual records organized in rows.
      Each record is composed of columns (also called fields).

      Every table is defined by a schema that describes the column names, data
      types, and other information.

      You can specify the schema of a table when it is created, or you can create
      a table without a schema and declare the schema in the load job that first
      populates it with data.
