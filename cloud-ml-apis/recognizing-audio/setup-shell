There are three audio files: "quote1.wav", "quote2.wav",
and "quote3.wav". Test your pop culture knowledge by identifying
the undeniably classic 90's movie these quotes are from. Convert the audio into
text using the Speech to Text API and report back with the title of the film.

*HINT* Use the command "gcloud ml" to get started.

When you think you know the answer, type "answer" and press ENTER.

Try running the following command:

    gcloud ml speech recognize quote1.wav --language-code=en

Run the same command using "quote2.wav" and "quote3.wav".

If you don't recognize the movie, run the quotes using the googler script and that
should help narrow it down:

    googler "this is a movie quote!"
