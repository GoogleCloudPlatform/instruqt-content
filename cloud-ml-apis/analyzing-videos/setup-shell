# Your Quest
-------------------------------

The puppy in "files/video1.mp4" wants to be your friend! But only if you can
find her. Using "gcloud", send this precious pup through Google's Video
Intelligence API and report back the starting time in seconds (for example, "7")
when she appears.

When you think you know the answer, type "answer" and press ENTER.

*HINT* Use the command "gcloud ml vision" to get started.
