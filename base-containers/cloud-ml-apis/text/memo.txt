Dear employees of Donald Fleasley and Sons,
I want to thank you very much for all the hard work you've done. I want to thank everyone, that is, except for Paul Fleishman. I have it on good account Paul has been using the water cooler as his personal aquarium, despite multiple warnings not to do so. Paul's phone number is 111-222-3456. Join me in making him feel ashamed of his actions.

Paul, it would be appreciated if you kept all aquarium activities at home. Even though you named your goldfish Fatty, which is absolutely adorable, we still need you to take Fatty home.

Thank you everyone.
Sincerely,
Revolio Clockberg Jr.
