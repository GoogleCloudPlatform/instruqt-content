  # What is Google Cloud Storage?

  Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data
  at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including
  serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery,
  or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

  assignment: |-
    We have provided you with stubbed out code written in Node.js and Python (
    example.js, and example.py).

    Read the appropriate Cloud Storage docs, by running ./nodejs-docs, or ./python-docs.
    And finish implementing the logic for creating a bucket (you may use
    vim, nano, or emacs as your editor).

    Use python or node to execute your application, and then click "check" to test
    your solution.
