  # What is Google Cloud Storage?

  Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data
  at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including
  serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery,
  or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

  title: Level 1 - it all begins with a bucket
  teaser: Demonstrate that you can create a Cloud Storage bucket... before time runs
    out.
  assignment: |-
    By modifying python/challeng.py, node/challenge.js, go/challenge.go, or using gsutil directly, create
    a bucket named $BUCKET_NAME.

    If you use python, JavaScript, or go, ensure that you run your application
    (with python, node, or go respectively).

    Feeling stuck? run gsutil --help, or cat help.txt.

    Hit the "Check" button when you are done.

  teaser: It's time to upload some content to your newly created bucket.
  assignment: |-
    Modify the python/challeng.py, node/challenge.js, go/challenge.go, or use gsutil directly. Upload
    the local file foo.txt to a file named bar.txt in the bucket you created in the
    last challenge.

    If you modify a challenge file (instead of using gsutil), ensure that you run your application
    (with python, node, or go respectively).
